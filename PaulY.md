#About Me

**List three words that describe you.**

Hello, my name is Paul and three words that describe me are kind, quiet, and tall.

**Write a few sentences or a paragraph about your favorite hobby, your favorite animal, or another personal favorite suitable for sharing on a public site.**

I enjoy reading, working out, the outdoors, playing video games (on hold until I finish Lambda School!) and spending time with family. My favorite animal is my West Highland Terrier Jak, and I am also a kitten dad to Prince and Ginger.
